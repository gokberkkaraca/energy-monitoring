# day-monitoring
- [x] Take accelerometer and heartrate (HR) on the watch during day and night, and send it to the
tablet. Synchronize data to the cloud.

- [x] Detection of abrupt changes on the accelerometer signal on the watch (particular numbers
will be given to the student), which triggers a notification, and store that as an event that is
sent to the tablet.

- [x] Detection of increase on HR (above 100 beats per minute), the duration of the HR increase,
and the timestamps of begin-end.

- [x] Visualize on a time plot on the tablet, the accelerometer traces together with the events
associated to changes on the accelerometer signal or heartrate.

- [x] Synchronizing the gathered data with the physical activity, by gathering information about
workouts (you can use external application, like Android Health app, or develop your own
tracking system).
